\section{Introduction}

Writing a submission for CG:YRF is one of the basic problems every motivated
junior researcher in Computational Geometry faces...

\section{Related Work}
Several established people have already worked on the topic of our paper,
including \cite{abghz-dfstkcd-2000}.

\section{Our Results}
There is a lot of stuff that we figured out...

First we would like to remind you how cute the logo of CCCG 2003 was:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.8\columnwidth]{cccgLogo}
  \caption{This was the logo of CCCG 2003.}
  \label{fig:logo}
\end{figure}

\begin{conj}
Could it really be like this?
\end{conj}
\begin{obs}
Probably not ...
\end{obs}

\begin{definition}
Some things are just not definable ..
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
This is the most important theorem.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
It even comes with a proof ...
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
And then we also found this lemma ...
\end{lemma}

There should be some more text explaining research results in some additional sections, but since this is only an example file ...

\section{Conclusion}

What we did is amazing and improves everything that was there before.
