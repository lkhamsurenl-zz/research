# Holy Tree implementation and visualization.

This repo includes algorithm implementation and visualization for multiple
source shortest path for graphs embedded in higher genus surfaces.

## Running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lkhamsurenl/research.git
cd research/HolyImpl/
python src/main.py
```

This will generate pdf files for primal and dual graphs as 
"resources/<today-date>-primal.pdf" and "resources/<today-date>-dual.pdf"
respectively.
