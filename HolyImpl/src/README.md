# Holy Tree implementation and visualization.

This repo includes algorithm implementation and visualization for multiple
source shortest path for graphs embedded in higher genus surfaces.

## Running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lkhamsurenl/research.git
cd research/HolyImpl/src/
python main.py
```

This will generate pdf files for primal and dual graphs, with each pivot in 
separate page.
